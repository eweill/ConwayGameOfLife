    "__Project Description__: Conway's game of life is a cellular automaton devised by John Horton Conway in 1970.\n",
    "The \"game\" is structured so that the evolution is only based on the initial state, meaning no user input is needed.  Initial configurations can be created randomly or by creating known patterns with particular properties.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A set of rules is derived that mimics growth of a colony of some biological organisms.  In most cases, the \"game\" is played on a two-dimensional grid which contains \"dead\" and \"living\" cells.  The following are a small subset of the rules that govern the evolution of the \"game\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "- __Reproduction__: If a \"dead\" cell is surrounded by exactly 3 \"living\" cells, it become a \"living\" cell\n",
    "- __Underpopulation__: If a \"living\" cell is surrounded by fewer than two \"living\" cells, it dies.\n",
    "- __Overpopulation__: If a \"living\" cell is surrounded by more than three \"living\" cells, it dies.\n",
    "- __Stasis__: If a \"living\" cell is surrounded by two or three \"living\" cells, it survives."
